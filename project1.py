# Problem: How are we testing password requirements?
# Solution(s): At least 8 characters long
#   Contains at least one uppercase letter
#   Contains at least one lowercase letter
#   Contains at least one digit
#   Contains at least one of these characters: !, ?, @, #, $, ^, &, *, _, -
#   Doesnâ€™t contain any spaces
#   -String methods? Regular Expression? Both are acceptable solutions. Regex is more advanced and will save you a few lines of code
# Test, push code, test push code, test push code :)


# Problem: How are we handling login process after successful sign up?
# Solution: With the assumption that after testing, the username and password fulfill requirements, we can reassign these values to more descriptive variables that are meant for the sign in and do a final test with a simple if else. Ternary operators are off the table as they cannot be used in a conditional expression.
# Test, push code, test push code, test push code :)
