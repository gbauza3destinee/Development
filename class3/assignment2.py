"""
Write a program that will calculate the area of a triangle, 
below is the equation needed to solve this problem

Area of Triangle = 1/2 x base x height

For your example, base = 20 , height = 15
Requirements 
- Comment your code 
- Use proper naming for your variables
- Include a String within your print builtin function that says
"The area of your triangle is " as output (formatted string)

print(f"ENTRYGOESHERE{variable}")
"""

base = 20
height = 15
#Equation is base * height * 1/2
area = (base * height)* 1/2
#String formatted 
print(f"The area of a rectangle with{base} inches and {height} inches 
      is : {area}")
